# Tic Tac Toe Subscriber Refactor

**Did you know??**

There's a YouTube video I made about this repository. [You should watch it.]()

## Quickstart

There are two examples in this repository that show how the `/original` project could be refactored using different libraries and patterns. I suggest reading through them in the following order.

1. Vanilla Refactor - this is the _closest_ representation of the original project and I highly recommend starting here since the remaining examples build off of the patterns here. You can also view the `typescript` Git branch to see how this would look written in TS rather than JS.
2. React Refactor - this shows a React implementation of the project, which is a much more _declarative_ approach than the vanilla implementations, which are mostly _imperative_. See my post on [declarative vs. imperative programming](https://www.zachgollwitzer.com/posts/imperative-programming). This also has a TypeScript implementation on the `typescript` branch.
